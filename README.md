# stego_trello

Tool created for the class "Advanced Persistent Threats and Information Leakage" from the Cybersecurity Master's in the Carlos III University.

This stego tool intends to hide information in Trello, using different features offered by that application.

In order to use this stego tool, an account in Trello is necessary, as well as the Selenium library provided by Java.

There are different features developed in the tool, as well as other that may continue to be developed in the future, hopefully.
